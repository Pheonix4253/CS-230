Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted us to design a game with the following requirements. A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
Each team will have multiple players assigned to it. Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.
I think that I did particualrly well in the creation of the UML. I feel like this was the most useful tool for me in the long run because when creating the actual code for 
the program it became kind of like a guide to follow. Working through the design document, i found it very helpful that it was broken down by sections because this allowed 
me to do the research for that section which then impacted the next. With the impact that the different sections made upon each other I was able to look back and use some 
of the information and thoughts of the previous installments and make my work easier. 

I think that the area that could use some improvment for me would be the research of the client side ofthings for the servers. I should have scrounged around some more and 
done more reading to get a better grasp on what the clients would have to deal with depending on their choice of host. I interpreted the needs of the user based on the requirements 
that were given in the begining of the project. I implemented them into t he desogn with the code that was used for the game. It is important to consider and implement what the client asks of you as a designer because this way the client will get exactly what they were asking for in their project and you will have done your job correctly. For this project I had very little knoledge of what I was doing so I approached it in a way where I used my resources like following the UML which had all that the client wanted broken down into seprate pieces and tackled them on section at a time. I believe that in future projects I will continue this method of as they say "eating a whole elephant one bite at a time" becuase for me it was an effective way to break down what I was doing and piece it together a little at a time.
